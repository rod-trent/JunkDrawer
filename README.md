# JunkDrawer

Miscellaneous stuff I create.

This repository serves as a personal "junk drawer" for various experimental projects, scripts, AI-powered tools, and utilities—mostly built around Grok, automation, cybersecurity, productivity, and creative fun.

**Last updated:** January 6, 2026 (recent additions/updates include **AWVA**, **PhishSim**, **TaskFolder**, and **Meal Finder**).
