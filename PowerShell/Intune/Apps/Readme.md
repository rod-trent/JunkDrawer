# Intune_Apps_Assignment.ps1

PowerShell script that adds an assignment to a list of Microsoft Intune apps:

1. Authenticate and Connect to Microsoft Graph: Use the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK to authenticate and connect to Microsoft Graph. This requires having the SDK installed and being authenticated to perform actions on behalf of a user or an administrator.

2. Define the List of App IDs: Specify the list of application IDs for which you want to add assignments. These IDs can be obtained from the Intune console or via a Graph API call to list apps.

3. Define the Assignment Parameters: Specify the parameters for the assignment, such as the target group (user or device group), the installation type (available or required), and any other relevant settings.

4. Loop Through Each App ID: For each app ID in the list, construct a request to add an assignment using the defined parameters.

5. Send the Request to Add the Assignment: Use the Graph API to send the request for each app, adding the assignment according to the specified parameters.

6. Error Handling: Include error handling to manage any issues that arise during the process, such as invalid app IDs or permissions issues.

7. Output the Results: Provide feedback on the success or failure of adding assignments to each app.
