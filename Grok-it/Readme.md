### I Stopped Using Google (and Every Other Search Engine)

Sometime in 2025 I quietly deleted my bookmarks for Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Perplexity.

I still browse the web constantly — articles, research papers, forum threads, documentation — but when I have a question about what I’m reading, I no longer open a search box.

I just highlight the text, right-click, and choose **“Grok-it”**.

Two seconds later a clean popup appears with Grok’s answer — always in perfect English, always relevant, always right there.

That’s why I built **Grok-it**.

### What Grok-it Actually Does

- Highlight any text on any page  
- Right-click → **“Grok-it”**  
- A dark, distraction-free popup instantly shows Grok’s full answer  
- No new tabs. No copy-paste. No leaving the page you’re reading.

It’s the fastest way I’ve ever found to go from “I wonder…” to “Oh, now I get it.”

### Why I Needed This

I read a lot.  
Research papers, long-form articles, technical docs, Reddit threads, tweets, patch notes — you name it.

Whenever something confused me, I used to:

1. Copy the confusing sentence  
2. Open a new tab  
3. Paste into Grok or a search engine  
4. Wait  
5. Switch context

That tiny friction added up to dozens of lost minutes per day.

Grok-it removes every single one of those steps.

Now I stay in flow. I read, I highlight, I understand — without ever breaking focus.

Done.

### How I Use It Every Day

- “Is this claim accurate?”  
- “Convert this code to Python”  
- “Who is this person?”

Highlight → right-click → understand. That’s it.

### Final Thought

I don’t search anymore.  
I just read — and when I don’t understand something, I Grok-it.

If you spend your days reading online, I think you’ll love it too.
